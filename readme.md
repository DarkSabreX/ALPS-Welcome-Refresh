### Why?

During my time as a Learning Management System Administrator I identified several areas of platform usage and learning engagement that could be improved by use of customized UX/UI pages. This is a sample of my first deployed solution, a new Landing Page.

### Language/Framework

Angular2

### Challenges/Solutions

This was designed for use in the Cornerstone LMS platform. While very powerful and robust, it is not designed for a client to perform deep HTML/JS customization on. By design the custom HTML components only allow for use of a sanitized subset of HTML and CSS tags. I developed a method to allow deployment of fully interactive pages using Angular2 as the JS framework by leveraging the Computer Based Training upload tools to house the HTML/JS files needed to deploy the pages.
